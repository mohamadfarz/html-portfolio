  <h1>The Best Movies According to Farz</h1>

  <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>Burnt</h3>
  <p>This is my favourite movie. It shows the love and passion for the work and how to achieve things you want the most.</p>

  <h3>Sound of Metal</h3>
  <p>This is more of a philosophical movie that teaches you how to accept the loss and make peace with the reality and present condition.</p>

  <h3>A Seperation</h3>
  <p>It's a beautiful movie about the seperation of a husband and wife. It also shows how the kids suffer from the fight and ego of their parents.</p>
